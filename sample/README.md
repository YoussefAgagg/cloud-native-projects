# Sample example of running spring boot app in Kubernetes cluster in local machine
to run the application 
```bash
./gradlew bootrun
```
to package your application as a container image, using Cloud Native [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/)
```bash
./gradlew bootBuildImage
```
to run the build image 
```bash
docker run --rm  --platform linux/amd64 --name sample -p 8080:8080 sample:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```
go to: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
you will see the welcome message.

install minikube and set up a Kubernetes cluster in your local development environment.
You can find the installation guide here [minikube ](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

start a local Kubernetes cluster:
```bash
minikube start
```
to deploy it to a cluster using Kubernetes
```bash
minikube image load sample:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```
```bash
kubectl create deployment sample --image=sample:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```
verify the creation of the Deployment object as follows:
```bash
kubectl get deployment
```
```bash
kubectl get pod
```
```bash
kubectl logs deployment/sample
```
expose the  Service to the cluster:
```bash
kubectl expose deployment sample --name=sample --port=8080
```
verify that itâ€™s been created correctly:
```bash
kubectl get service sample
```
forward the traffic from a local port on your computer (for example, 8000) to the port exposed by the Service inside the cluster (8080):
```bash
kubectl port-forward service/sample 8000:8080
```
Open a browser window, navigate to http://localhost:8000/ and verify that you still get the same greeting as before.

delete the Service : 
```bash
kubectl delete service sample
```
delete the Deployment :
```bash
kubectl delete deployment sample
```
you can stop the Kubernetes cluster with 
```bash
minikube stop
```
